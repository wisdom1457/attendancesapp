# Biometric Attendance System

This project is a PHP-based biometric attendance platform that demonstrates how to enroll employees and capture simulated fingerprint scans. It uses SQLite by default and ships with a simple admin experience for:

- Managing biometric enrollments with secure fingerprint templates.
- Capturing check-ins and check-outs from biometric devices.
- Reviewing real-time attendance dashboards and historical reports.

The app is intentionally lightweight so it can run anywhere PHP 8.1+ is available.

## Features

- 🔐 Session-based authentication with a seeded administrator account.
- 👩‍💼 Employee directory with autogenerated employee codes and hashed fingerprint phrases.
- ✋ Attendance capture screen that verifies fingerprint phrases before logging an event.
- 📊 Dashboard cards that summarize daily activity plus a live timeline feed.
- 📄 Filterable attendance report for auditing biometric scans.
- 🎨 Modern UI built with vanilla PHP and CSS—no frameworks required.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or later with the SQLite extension enabled.

### Installation

1. Install dependencies and seed the demo data:

   ```bash
   php scripts/setup.php
   ```

   The script creates the SQLite database (`storage/app.sqlite`), adds an administrator account, enrolls three example employees, and records a few sample scans.

2. Start the PHP development server from the `public/` directory:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

3. Sign in at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) using the seeded credentials:

   | Email                     | Password |
   | ------------------------- | -------- |
   | `admin@attendance.local`  | `admin123` |

4. Explore the app:

   - **Dashboard** – View live metrics and recent scans.
   - **Employees** – Enroll team members and copy their employee code.
   - **Capture Attendance** – Simulate a biometric check-in/out with the employee code and fingerprint phrase used during enrollment.
   - **Attendance Logs** – Audit historical scans and export data as needed.

## Configuration

Set any of the following environment variables (via `.env`) to customize the database connection:

- `DB_DRIVER` – `sqlite`, `mysql`, or `pgsql` (defaults to `sqlite`).
- `DB_DATABASE` – Absolute or relative path to the SQLite file, or the database name for other drivers.
- `DB_DSN` – Fully-qualified DSN if you prefer to provide one directly.
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_CHARSET` – Used when connecting to MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## Project structure

```
public/                   # Web front-end (login, dashboard, attendance tools)
scripts/setup.php         # Database bootstrap and seed script
src/                      # Reusable helpers, authentication, and repositories
storage/app.sqlite        # Generated SQLite database (created at runtime)
```

## Security notice

This application is designed for demonstrations, workshops, and assessments. It should not be used in production without additional hardening, error handling, and true biometric integrations. Always replace the seeded credentials before deploying to a real environment.
